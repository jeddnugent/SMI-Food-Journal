# SMI-Food-Journal

SMI Food Journal is a full stack project created for [Successful Minds Institute](https://successfulminds.com.au). 
The purpose of the journal is to allow clients of SMI to track each meal they eat over the course of a week where they will
answer a series of prompts regarding their mood and the enviroment around the meal which then will be accessed by practitioners on a subsequent consultation.
The information gained by these surveys will then help inform futher advice and treatment for the client and allow practitioners to best help
their growth through holistic means.

##### Tech Stack
- React (TypeScript) Web App frontend
- Express.js Backend API Client
- PostgreSQL Database backend


##### LocalHost Deployment

## Available Scripts

Within the client directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**


If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
